# notesToMD
 Simple programm that turns apple notes to Markdown files.
 Currently turns all the notes in the folder labeled "toObsidian" into MD files and ignores the rest. 
 
 - The Heading of the note is being used as the file Name.
 - The variable pathname is being pulled from a file called "pathname.txt" which has to be in the projects root directory. 
 - The path should be stored as plain text, without quotation marks and point to a folder where the created MD file will be moved to.
